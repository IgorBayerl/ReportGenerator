# Go Report Generator

This project is a Go port of the excellent [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) tool by Daniel Palme. It aims to provide a fast, dependency-free, and cross-platform code coverage reporting tool with a focus on modern development workflows.

## Motivation

The original ReportGenerator is a mature and feature-rich tool that has been a staple in the .NET ecosystem for over 14 years. The motivation for this Go port is threefold:
1.  **For Study:** To delve into the complexities of code coverage formats and report generation, providing a significant learning opportunity.
2.  **Dependency-Free:** To create a single, native executable that runs on any platform without requiring external runtimes like .NET, making it ideal for containerized CI/CD pipelines.
3.  **Extensibility:** To build a modern foundation in Go that can be easily extended to support new formats and features tailored to current needs, such as first-class support for Go's own coverage tooling.

## System Design

The Go Report Generator is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, drawing inspiration from the original's architecture while leveraging Go's strengths.

*   **Entrypoint (`cmd/main.go`):** The main application entry point handles command-line argument parsing and orchestrates the report generation workflow. It is also responsible for composing the application's dependencies, such as creating parser and language processor instances and injecting them into their respective factories.
*   **Configuration (`internal/reportconfig`, `internal/settings`):** A dedicated package for managing all configuration, from input files and output directories to filters and report types.
*   **Parser Factory (`internal/parser`):** At the core of the input processing is a parser factory. It is explicitly given a list of all available parser implementations (e.g., for Cobertura, GoCover). For a given input file, the factory iterates through these parsers and uses the first one that reports it can handle the format. This makes it easy to add support for new formats by simply creating a new parser and adding it to the factory's constructor in `cmd/main.go`.
*   **Language-Specific Processing (`internal/language`):** To handle language-specific nuances like formatting C#/.NET identifiers or calculating Go-specific metrics, a language processor factory is used. Similar to the parser factory, it holds a list of available language processors. When processing a source file, it selects the appropriate processor by checking which one supports the file's extension (e.g., `.cs`, `.go`). This allows for clean separation of concerns, where parsers focus on format and processors focus on language semantics.
*   **Intermediate Model (`internal/model`):** Once a report is parsed, its data is translated into a standardized intermediate model. This decouples the input formats from the output reporters, meaning any supported input format can be used to generate any supported output format.
*   **Analysis Engine (`internal/analyzer`):** The analyzer takes the results from one or more parsers and merges them into a single, unified `SummaryResult`. This is what enables the powerful feature of combining coverage reports from different test runs or even different languages (e.g., C# and Go) into one consolidated report.
*   **Report Builders (`internal/reporter`):** Report builders are responsible for generating the final output. The `htmlreport` package, for instance, generates a sophisticated single-page application (SPA).
*   **Angular SPA Frontend (`angular_frontend_spa`):** The HTML report is not just a static file. It's a full-fledged Angular application that provides rich, interactive features like real-time filtering, sorting, and collapsible views, offering a much more dynamic user experience than traditional reports.
