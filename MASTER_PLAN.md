# MASTER_PLAN.md: Porting ReportGenerator HTML Reporting to Go

## ðŸŽ¯ Overall Project Goal
To port the HTML reporting functionality from the C# ReportGenerator tool to the Go version (`go_report_generator`). The initial focus is on processing Cobertura XML input and generating rich HTML reports, aiming for feature parity with the original C# tool's HTML output. The architecture should allow for future expansion to other report types and input formats.

---
## ðŸ“Š Current Status (Go Project)
* **Input Parsing:** Successfully parses Cobertura XML files.
* **Internal Data Model:** An internal data model exists, populated from the Cobertura input.
* **Reporting Engine:**
    * Basic reporter interface (`ReportBuilder`) is defined.
    * `TextSummary` report generation is implemented and functional.
* **CLI:** Basic command-line interface accepts input XML and report type.
---
## leveragedLeverage (Go Port vs. C# Original)
* **Cobertura Parsing (Go: Done):**
    `go_report_generator/internal/parser/cobertura.go` parses the XML into `inputxml.CoberturaRoot`.
    This is analogous to C#'s `CoberturaParser.cs`.
* **Internal Data Model (Go: Done, Needs Verification for Completeness):**
    `go_report_generator/internal/model/*` (e.g., `analysis.go`, `metric.go`, etc.) defines structs like `SummaryResult`, `Assembly`, `Class`, `CodeFile`, `Method`, `Line`, `Metric`, `CodeElement`.
    This is analogous to C#'s `ReportGenerator.Core/Parser/Analysis/*`.
    *Action:* Verify if all necessary fields from C#'s analysis model (especially those used by HTML rendering like `HistoricCoverage`, `TestMethod` links, detailed branch info per line) are present or can be easily added to the Go model. Your `model/analysis.go Line` struct already has `CoveredBranches` and `TotalBranches`, which is great. `HistoricCoverage` is also present.
* **Analyzer (Go: Done, Needs Verification for Completeness):**
    `go_report_generator/internal/analyzer/*` populates the Go internal data model from `inputxml.CoberturaRoot`.
    This is analogous to the processing logic within C# parsers that hydrate `Parser.Analysis.Assembly`, `Parser.Analysis.Class`, etc.
    *Action:* Similar to the data model, ensure the analyzer populates all data points required for the rich HTML report.
* **Reporter Abstraction (Go: Done):**
    `go_report_generator/internal/reporter/reporter.go` defines the `ReportBuilder` interface.
    `go_report_generator/internal/reporter/textsummary/reporter.go` is an existing implementation. This provides a pattern.
* **Angular SPA (C#: Can be directly COPIED and BUILT):**
    The entire `src/AngularComponents` directory from the C# project.
    Its build process (`ng build` defined in `angular.json`) produces static assets (JS, CSS, `index.html` shell).
    *Key Insight:* The Go backend does not *run* Angular. It will *serve* or *integrate* the pre-compiled static assets from Angular's `dist` folder.
* **Static Assets (CSS/JS) (C#: Can be directly COPIED):**
    Files in `src/ReportGenerator.Core/Reporting/Builders/Rendering/resources/` (e.g., `custom.css`, `custom.js`, `chartist.min.css/js`) can be copied into an `assets/` directory in the Go project.
* **HTML Rendering Logic (C#: Needs TRANSLATION to Go):**
    C#'s `HtmlRenderer.cs` and `HtmlReportBuilderBase.cs` contain the core logic for:
    * Generating HTML structure (summary page, class detail pages).
    * Iterating through the data model to populate tables, lists, metrics.
    * Creating links between summary and detail pages.
    * Embedding or linking static/Angular assets.
    * Generating JavaScript data variables for the Angular app.
    This logic will be translated into Go, primarily using the `html/template` package and Go string manipulation.
* **Source File Reading (Go: Partially Exists, Needs Integration):**
    `go_report_generator/internal/filereader/filereader.go` exists for counting lines. It needs to be enhanced or complemented to read file content for display.
    C#'s `SourceFileRenderer.cs` (or similar logic within `HtmlRenderer`) handles reading source files and applying CSS classes. This part needs translation to Go.

---
## ðŸ”‘ Key Considerations & Principles
* **Reference C# Project:** The original C# `ReportGenerator` project is the primary source of truth for features, logic, and UI.
* **Expandability:** Design Go interfaces and structures (especially for reporters and data processing) to easily accommodate new report types (e.g., XML, JSON, Markdown Summary) or input formats in the future without major refactoring.
* **Modularity:** Keep components (parsing, analysis, report generation, asset handling) as decoupled as possible.
* **Configuration:** Plan for report generation configuration options (e.g., via CLI, `.json` file).
* **Translations:** The Angular app uses a `translations` JavaScript object. These strings need to be extracted from C#'s `ReportResources.resx` and made available to the Go-generated HTML.
